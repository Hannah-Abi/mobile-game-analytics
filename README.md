## Mobile Game Analytics
### Business Questions 
1. Short Description of the Data set 
The database contains three datasets: account, account_date_session, and iap_purchase. 
* ‘Account’ dataset:
    * The ‘account’ table includes user profiles, including users’ unique account ID, datetime they created a game account, country code, devices they used, and some other relevant information.
    * According to the dataset, there are 112 792 users, of which 107 users have country information missing. The country information is important for sales by geography analysis. 
*	‘Account_date_session’ dataset:
    *	The dataset contains the number of sessions for the users for the days they have been active. The session does not count when the user created an account.
    *	There is no abnormal about the dataset. 
*	‘iap_purchase’ dataset:
    *	The dataset contains in-app purchases by users.
    *	There are 2 paying users that are missing geographic information. Luckily, they only made up 20 euros purchase. 
2. Analyzing the Daily Active Users (DAU)
* The chart depicts the Daily Active Users (DAU) and its components—new users and returning users—over a specified time period. Notably, there is a significant surge in DAU from the start of the year until mid-February 2016. 
* Subsequently, DAU experiences fluctuations, ranging between 4300 and 5400.
* Consistently, users engage with the game on a daily basis. 
* Nevertheless, there are instances throughout the year where DAU experiences sudden drops, such as on March 15th and September 8th.
* Moreover, DAU remains consistently stable, hovering around 5100 for the duration of July and August.

* The reason for the sudden decrease in the DAU might be: 
   -	Technical issues.
   -	Game updates or changes 
   -	User burnout or fatigue.
